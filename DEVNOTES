Error handling:
- At source of error, log the error, then rethrow the Exception
- When rethrow, wrap the exception only when necessary (e.g. adding new info). Otherwise rethrow the original error
- Intermediate functions just rethrow error
- Topmost function use try catch

Limitations:
- 1 Server / Client instance per run
- 1 Server can contain multiple RPC services and methods
- 1 Client can invoke any service multiple times
- 1 param / return value per RPC method
- Namespaces not implemented:
    - A unique RPC method is identified by service name and method name only
    - A unique message is identified by its name
- Dockerfiles and compose.yaml cannot be generated at runtime
    - path-related configs should not be changed
- Cross-import between different proto namespaces is not allowed
