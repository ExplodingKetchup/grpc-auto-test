TODO:

- Auto read log files and verify
- Containerize core service
- Deploy arbitrarily 1 server and 1 client only with docker
- Test with multiple rpc files
- Codegen Dockerfiles and compose.yaml
- CoreService clean up service
- Testcase from users read from files (not resources) or allow user to edit and save to files

- (Optional) Compile common.protobin in Core project
- (Optional) multiple test cases per service
- (Optional) Streaming RPC
- (Optional) Allow namespace to differentiate methods with same name, e.g. ns1.AService.aMethod != ns2.AService.aMethod
