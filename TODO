TODO:

- Add maven invoker check for maven error and throw (50%, not thrown)
- Auto read log files and verify
- Containerize core service
- Test with multiple rpc files
- Codegen Dockerfiles and compose.yaml
- Testcase from users read from files (not resources) or allow user to edit and save to files
- Implement RPC throwing exceptions (we purposefully throw exceptions from server to see what client received)
- (Optional) Compile common.protobin in Core project
- (Optional) multiple test cases per service
- (Optional) Streaming RPC
- Include metadata in RPC calls
- Exception / Error handling
- Channels-specific problems (e.g. compression)
- Deadlines inconsistencies (Set same deadlines for both client and server, then wait and send delayed response)
- RPC cancellation inconsistencies
- RPC status difference between server and client due to languages? (e.g. server: success, client: fail)
- Python: protoc generate command: python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc --proto_path=proto --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. proto/*.proto
- Python: Are rpc_grpc_pb2.py generated if rpc.proto doesn't have service definition?
- Core: Review Docker health check. If client shutdown too fast, healthcheck hangs until timeout.
- Protoscope: protoscope -descriptor-set protobin/common.protobin -message-type numbered_hotpot.BigHotpotOfTerror -print-field-names -explicit-wire-types out/server/numbered_hotpot_HotpotService_unaryPot_param_0.bin
